"""Adapter over hydroseason's native DEA Water Observation Statistics loader.

hydroseason owns STAC search, unsigned-COG/GDAL configuration, and the
Dask-backed load itself (``hydroseason.open_wo_statistics``). This module's
only job is to convert that raw ``xr.Dataset`` into the frozen
:class:`WoStatistics` value HydroFragments' zoning code will consume, and to
enforce the one check that legitimately belongs on this side of the
repository boundary: refusing a geographic CRS for an area metric
(``guard_area_metric_crs``, spec §8 guard 8), because hydroseason has no
``pyproj`` dependency and must never import from HydroFragments (dependency
direction is one-way: HydroFragments -> hydroseason).

This module does NOT build zones and does NOT reduce statistics into a
planning mask (``WetPlanningFootprint`` / ``build_wet_planning_footprint``)
-- both are later tasks. It only adapts one loaded Dataset into one
dataclass.
